# My Bots

## Basic Idea
The program is intended to create a random 3D creature that isn't just
overlapping kinematic chains. That is, it will make a random body (including 
bodies like "lizards" or "horses") with a random number of segments, 
randomly shaped segments, randomly placed segments and random sensor placement 
on the body. Links with sensors are colored green, and links without 
sensors are colored blue.

## Running the Program
Download the files and type `python3 search.py` into your terminal to
run. A python pop-up should appear with your random creature. Run
again for a new creature.
